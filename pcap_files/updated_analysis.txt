## Traffic Analysis by Port

1. Port 80 (HTTP)
   * Total Traffic: 1,245 packets
   * Normal Traffic: 324 packets
   * Suspicious Traffic: 921 packets
   * Top Attack Types: SQL Injection, XSS, Directory Traversal

2. Port 443 (HTTPS)
   * Total Traffic: 68 packets
   * Normal Traffic: 68 packets
   * Suspicious Traffic: 0 packets
   * Notes: No attacks detected on encrypted traffic

3. Multiple Ports (Port Scan)
   * Total Traffic: 1,145 packets
   * Ports Scanned: 1-1024 + common higher ports
   * Notes: OS fingerprinting and service version detection attempted

## Attack Success Analysis

1. SQL Injection: Failed (404 - Page not found)
   * Recommendation: Ensure proper input validation on all web forms

2. XSS Attempts: Failed (404 - Page not found)
   * Recommendation: Implement Content-Security-Policy headers

3. Directory Traversal: Failed (404 - Page not found)
   * Recommendation: Verify path sanitization in all file operations

4. Admin Access: Failed (404 - Page not found)
   * Recommendation: Use non-standard paths for administrative interfaces

## Enhanced Security Recommendations

1. Web Application Security
   * Implement a proper WAF with SQL injection and XSS filtering
   * Enable rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
   * Add CAPTCHA for login attempts after 3 failures

2. Network Security
   * Implement proper network segmentation
   * Deploy a full-featured IDPS solution
   * Configure alerts for scanning activities

3. Authentication Security
   * Enforce strong password policies
   * Implement multi-factor authentication for admin access
   * Use account lockout policies

4. Monitoring Improvements
   * Deploy file integrity monitoring
   * Implement centralized logging
   * Configure correlation rules for detecting multi-stage attacks
