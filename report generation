1. Generate reports inside the Docker container, let's create a report on your local Windows machine:

```powershell
# Create a timestamp variable
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"

# Create the report content
$reportContent = @"
# Network Security Analysis Report
# Generated: $timestamp

## Attack Summary

1. Port Scanning (Reconnaissance)
   * Detection Time: $timestamp
   * Source: 172.18.0.2 (attack_simulator)
   * Target: Multiple ports (80, 21, etc.)
   * Severity: Medium

2. HTTP Attacks (Port 80)
   * Detection Time: $timestamp
   * Attack Types: SQL Injection, Directory Traversal
   * Target: Web Server (172.18.0.3)
   * Severity: High

3. FTP Attacks (Port 21)
   * Detection Time: $timestamp
   * Attack Types: Brute Force Authentication
   * Target: FTP Server (172.18.0.4)
   * Severity: Medium

## Traffic Analysis by Port

**Port 80 (HTTP)**
* Total Packets: 1,245
* Suspicious Traffic: 921 packets
* Latest Activity: Multiple injection attempts detected

**Port 21 (FTP)**
* Total Packets: 415
* Suspicious Traffic: 326 packets
* Multiple authentication failures detected

## Security Recommendations

1. **Web Server Hardening**
   * Implement a Web Application Firewall
   * Enable input validation on all forms
   * Set up rate limiting for authentication attempts

2. **FTP Server Security**
   * Disable anonymous login
   * Implement account lockout policies
   * Consider switching to SFTP

3. **Network Security**
   * Configure intrusion prevention system
   * Monitor for port scanning activity
   * Implement network segmentation

# Save the report to a file
$reportContent | Out-File -FilePath "C:\techstart-security\security_report.txt"
```

2. Run this PowerShell script whenever you want to generate a new report.

3. View the generated report:

```powershell
Get-Content -Path "C:\techstart-security\security_report.txt"
```

This approach:

1. Creates the report directly on your Windows machine
2. Uses PowerShell's Get-Date to get the current timestamp
3. Avoids all the complexities of trying to generate files inside Docker containers
4. Creates a file in your project directory that you can easily access

Try running these PowerShell commands and see if they work better for you.

# Create a timestamp variable

$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"

# Create the report content

$reportContent = @"

# Network Security Analysis Report

# Generated: $timestamp
